                    Made with JSON, React, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>[3.] DICE SIMULATOR</h2>
                <p>
                    A simple dice simulator that has a GUI made with Python.<br>
                    Libraries used are:<br>
                    1.Tkinter: used for handling the GUI.<br>
                    2.Pillow: used for image processing (the images of the different sides of a dice)<br>
                    3.Random: used for generating a random side of the dice.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>[4.] WEATHER APP</h2>
                <p>
                    A Python project made with the use of requests and API to display the current weather of the required city.<br>
                    Libraries used are:<br>
                    1.requests: to send and fetch requests to the API of the website.<br>
                    2.dotenv: reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables.<br>
                </p>

                <h2 style="color: white;">[1.] PULSE DETECTOR</h2>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    A pulse detector detects the pulse from your wrist displays the pulse rate and plots the graph of your pulse. <br>It uses the following components:<br>
                    1.esp32: The microcontroller used for this project is esp32 because of its powerful features and compact size which makes it easy to use.<br>
                    2.sensors: 3 infrared sensors are used for sensing the 3 different pulses from your wrist: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.<br>
                    3.Processing(Software): this software was used for making and integrating GUI with the hardware.<br>
                    4. Arduino IDE: this was used for programming the esp32 board.<br>
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: white;">[2.] BIANRY ADDER WITH 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY</h2>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    Calculates the sum of two 3-bit numbers and displays it on the 7-segment display.<br> The components used are:<br>
                    1.FPGA BOARD: programmed the board using Verilog.<br>
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: white;">[3.] WEIN BRIDGE OSCILLATOR WITH PEAK-TO-PEAK DETECTOR</h2>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    The components used are:<br>
                    1.Wein bridge oscillator circuit: The Wien bridge oscillator is an audio frequency sine wave oscillator of high stability and simplicity.<br> The feedback signal in this circuit is connected to the non-inverting input terminal so that the op-amp is working as a non-inverting amplifier. <br>Therefore, the feedback network need not provide any phase shift.<br>
                    2.Peak-To-Peak Detector Circuit: Peak detector circuits are used to determine the peak (maximum) value of an input signal.<br> It stores the peak value of input voltages for an infinite time duration until it comes to a reset condition. <br>The peak detector circuit utilizes its property of following the highest value of an input signal and storing it.<br>
